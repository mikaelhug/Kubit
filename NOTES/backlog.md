# Backlog

- vfkit console: arm64 ISO logs to ttyAMA0; direct-kernel boot with `console=hvc0` would
  give a readable `console.log`.
- vmnet NAT is flaky for ~2 min after VM boot; harness could poll :50000 before returning.
- Two clusters on one L2 with the same MetalLB range collide (both announce .200); the
  create wizard could warn when a range overlaps another stored cluster's.
- `status` etcd leader detection only asks the first reachable control plane; a
  cluster whose first CP is down reports no leader.
- Stale mirror pods (`Pending`, old image) linger in kube-system for a while after a
  Kubernetes upgrade; harmless, but the dashboard could surface component versions
  from the API server rather than pod images.
